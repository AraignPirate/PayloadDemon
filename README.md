# PayloadDemon

A automated Meterpreter payload generator script in Bash That can start Listener automatically for specified payload. (only for KALI Linux)

## Get Started

Setup is easy just change location to bin folder using :

> cd PayloadDemon/bin

Then run ***setup_demon.sh*** script.

> chmod +x setup_demon.sh && ./setup_demon.sh

- This will create the required Directory Structure to support this program.

## Run Script
