# PayloadDemon

A automated Meterpreter payload generator script in Bash That can start Listener automatically for specified payload. (only for KALI Linux)

## Get Started

Setup is easy just change location to bin folder using :

> cd PayloadDemon/bin

Then run ***setup_demon.sh*** script.

> chmod +x setup_demon.sh && ./setup_demon.sh

- This will create the required Directory Structure to support this program.

## Run Script

To start this script, we need to give **executable permissions** for that type these commands :

> cd PayloadDemon
> chmod +x Payload_Demon.sh

Now ro ***Run*** type:

> ./Payload_Demon.sh

If all setup was successfull then it will open a **xfce4-terminal** like this.

- This script gives 3 options to generate basic payload depending on target machine.

For ***Android*** Payload can be generated by option ***1***

- ***LHOST*** : *IP* where the reverse shell will connect.
- ***LPORT*** : *PORT NUMBER* where the reverse shell will connect.
- ***NAME*** : Name of payload file with extention.
